## 🐞 Submitting Issues

If you encounter a bug, crash, or unexpected behavior, please open an issue and include the following:

- A clear description of the problem  
- Steps to reproduce it  
- Screenshots (if applicable)  
- **Your `logs.txt` file** (if available)

### 📄 Where to find `logs.txt`

Depending on how you installed or ran the application, `logs.txt` will be located in one of the following paths:

#### 🖥️ Installation Mode

| Scope         | Path Example                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| All Users     | `C:\ProgramData\TeraTermUI\logs.txt`                                          |
| Current User  | `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\TeraTermUI\logs.txt`                   |

#### 📦 Portable Mode

| Context        | Path Example                        |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Same folder    | `.\TeraTermUI\logs.txt`             |
| Relative path  | Look for `logs.txt` next to the `.exe` or launcher script |

> 💡 **Tip:** If you're not sure which mode you're using, check if there's a `database.db` next to your program. That usually indicates portable mode.

You can:
- Drag & drop the file directly into your GitHub issue
