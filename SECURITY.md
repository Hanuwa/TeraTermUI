# 🔒 How Your Student Number and PIN Are Protected


The `LocalDataStore` system protects sensitive credentials, such as student numbers and PINs, when you **choose to save them locally** on a Windows device. Saving is completely optional , you can always enter your details manually instead. 
When used, the system applies AES-GCM-256 encryption for confidentiality and integrity, while the encryption keys themselves are protected through a layered approach: a random master key is bound to your user and device using Windows DPAPI, 
and each key also has a unique passphrase stored securely in Windows Credential Manager. To prevent tampering, the key file (`keyset.json`) is signed with HMAC-SHA256, and its access is restricted so only the current Windows user can read it. 
The system also handles automatic key rotation, and secure retirement of old keys. Together, these measures ensure that even if the key file is copied or exposed, it cannot be decrypted or modified without access to both your Windows account and Credential Manager.

## ✅ Features
- **AES-GCM-256 encryption** – strong encryption with integrity checks.  
- **Key derivation with HKDF-SHA256**, using:  
  - A **random master key** protected by **Windows DPAPI** (tied to your user + device).  
  - A **per-key random passphrase** stored in **Windows Credential Manager**.  
- **Tamper detection** – `keyset.json` is signed with **HMAC-SHA256**.  
- **File protection** – restricted to your Windows user (**ACL**) and hidden.  
- **Key auto-rotation** – every 90 days by default; old keys are kept temporarily for decryption, then retired.

## 📂 Stored Data
- Your **student number and PIN (encrypted only)** – never plaintext on disk.  
- `keyset.json` – contains encrypted keys, safe metadata, and HMAC.  
- **Per-key passphrases** – stored in **Windows Credential Manager** (scoped to your account).  

---

## 🛡️ Protection Scope
- Theft or tampering of the key file alone.  
- Casual access by other users on the same machine.  
- Data loss from partial/corrupt writes during updates.  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
Even with protections, risks remain:  
- If **malware runs as you**, it can:  
  - Access DPAPI and Credential Manager.  
  - Read secrets from app memory during use.  
  - Keylog your PIN when you type it.  
- **Admins/system-level attackers** can bypass local protections.  
- **Moving files to another device** won’t work (DPAPI-bound).  
- **Losing your Windows profile or Credential Manager items** = unrecoverable data.  

---

## 💡 Extra Security Tips
- Keep **Windows updated** and run **reputable anti-malware**.  
- Turn on **BitLocker or full-disk encryption**.  
- **Lock your session** when away.  
- Avoid **copying credentials to the clipboard**.

# 🗑️ Removing Your Saved Credentials

This script is especially useful for **portable users of the app**.  Because the portable version does not come with an uninstaller,  
saved credentials remain in **Windows Credential Manager** even if you simply delete the app folder.  
If you plan on **getting rid of the app completely**, you should run this script first to clean up any saved secrets.

👉 You can also delete your saved data without using the script —>  
just click the **“Delete Data”** button inside the **Help** window of the app.

💡 Even if you’ve already deleted the app folder, you can still download the cleanup script directly from 
[here](https://github.com/Hanuwa/TeraTermUI_Dev/raw/main/RemoveCredentials.ps1) and run it

---

## ▶️ How to Use

1. Locate the script file: `RemoveCredentials.ps1` (distributed alongside the app).  
2. Right‑click → *Run with PowerShell* (or run from a PowerShell terminal).  
3. The script will:
   - Scan Credential Manager for your app’s saved entries.  
   - Show a preview of what it found.  
   - Ask whether to **delete all** or **pick specific items**.  
   - Require typing `DELETE` as final confirmation (unless you run with `-Force`).  

---

## ⚡ Advanced Usage

Run from a PowerShell prompt in the same folder as the script:

- **Delete All silently** (no output, no prompts, exits with code only)  
  ```powershell
  .\RemoveCredentials.ps1 -Silent

## 📝 Notes

- This script only deletes credentials saved **by this app,** not your other logins.
- Run it as the **same Windows user** who saved the student number and PIN.
- Once deleted, credentials **cannot be recovered.**
- **Installed (non‑portable) users** don’t have to run the script themselves,
  the built‑in uninstaller will call it automatically.
